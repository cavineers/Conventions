# Variable Naming
## "Regular" Variables
When naming a regular variable, use camel case.

In camel case, the first word is not capitalized while every subsequent word is. There is no space between the words. For example, a variable containing the age of a dog might be named as follows:  \
`dogAge`


## Constants
When naming constants, use pascal case. For example, when naming separate speeds

`RobotSpeed`

Instead of pascal case, you'd capitalize the first letter of the word. No space between them, same like camel case.
