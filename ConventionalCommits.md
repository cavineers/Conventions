# Conventional Commits

Our commits are structured as follows: `(commit type): (short description)`
- The commit type is the type of commit you are making. See the table below for the correct commit type.
- The short description is a short description of the commit. It should be short and concise, but still descriptive enough to understand what the commit is for.
