# Conventional Commits
Below is a table displaying the correct commit type depending on the type of commit. Include the commit type at the beginning of each commit description.

Purpose of Commit | Commit Type
--- | ---
To add a feature or functionality | `feat`
To fix a bug or resolve issues and errors in code | `fix`

For example, assume you fixed an infinite loop in a line of your team's code. Your description might read as follows:
